            <p>
              I'm a student developer who genuinely enjoys understanding how things work under the hood. 
              I started programming out of curiosity and built my first complete project in Class 12 — 
              an experience that taught me more about problem-solving than any tutorial ever could.
            </p>

            <p>
              Right now, I'm focused on strengthening my fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, 
              and writing clean, readable code. I believe a strong foundation makes everything else 
              easier to learn. I'm not chasing every new framework; I prefer understanding <em>why</em> 
              something works before using it.
            </p>

            <p>
              I primarily work with <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Python</span> and{" "}
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium">C++</span> for algorithmic problem-solving, 
              and I'm developing my web skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also started 
              exploring the basics of machine learning to understand how intelligent systems are built.
            </p>

            <p>
              What drives me is the satisfaction of solving a problem after hours of thinking and 
              the excitement of building something that actually works. I don't claim to be an 
              expert — just someone consistently putting in the work to get better every day.
