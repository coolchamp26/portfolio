            <p>
              I'm a student developer who genuinely enjoys understanding how things work under the hood. 
              I started programming out of curiosity and built my first project in Class 12.
              That experience taught me more about problem-solving than any tutorial could.
            </p>

            <p>
              Right now, I'm focused on strengthening my fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, 
              and writing clean, readable code. I believe that a strong foundation makes everything else 
              easier to learn. I'm not chasing every new framework, I'd rather understand <em>why</em>
              something works before using it.
            </p>

            <p>
              I work primarily with <span className="text-foreground font-medium">Python</span> and{" "}
              <span className="text-foreground font-medium">C++</span> for algorithmic problem-solving, 
              and I'm building my web development skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also started 
              exploring machine learning basics to understand how intelligent systems are built.
            </p>

            <p>
              What drives me is the satisfaction of solving a problem after hours of thinking about it, 
              and the excitement of building something that actually works. I'm not claiming to be an 
              expert, I'm just someone who's putting in the work to get better every day.
            </p>
